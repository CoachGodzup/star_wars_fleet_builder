## Getting Started

### Docker (suggested)

In order to start the project, it's better if you use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) up and running in your machine

To start the project, go into main folder and start docker compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

### Npm (deprecated)

If you love the old fashioned way, you need an updated version of Node (tested on 19).

using NPM (you can choose yarn, pnpm or bun if you prefer)

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

If you want a developer mode, with autorefresh

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Boring stuff

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
